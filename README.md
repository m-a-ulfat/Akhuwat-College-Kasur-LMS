# 📚 Akhuwat Perl's Wisdom Library Management System  

## 📄 Project Summary  

The **Akhuwat Library Management System (ALMS)** is a custom-built, web-based solution developed for **Akhuwat College University Kasur** to digitalize and streamline library operations.  

Since 2020, the institute’s library, established in collaboration with **Chughtai Lab** has been operating on the open-source **Koha** platform. While functional, Koha has notable limitations, such as:  
- Limited integration and customization options  
- No commercial support  
- Lack of budgeting and audit account features  
- Limited archives management  
- Accessibility issues without internet  
- Complexity for non-technical users  
- Limited vendor support  

## To overcome these challenges, **ALMS** was developed with:  
- **Role-Based Access** for Admin, Librarian, and Student/Teacher dashboards  
- **Fine & Audit Management** for transparent record-keeping  
- **Vendor & Archives Management** with efficient tracking  
- **Book Inventory Management** including PDF uploads for digital resources  
- **Offline Accessibility Support**  
- **User-Friendly Interface** for smooth navigation and quick operations  

This system improves library operations, enhances the user experience, and increases resource management efficiency, ensuring both scalability and sustainability for future needs.
